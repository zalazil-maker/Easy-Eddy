```
Cost per user per month:

```

## Financial Projections

### Year 1 Conservative Model (5% Pro conversion rate)
```
Month 1:  50 users (3 Pro) = €25 revenue - €30 costs = -€5 (investment)
Month 3:  150 users (8 Pro) = €69 revenue - €32 costs = €37 profit
Month 6:  300 users (15 Pro) = €130 revenue - €33 costs = €97 profit
Month 12: 500 users (25 Pro) = €217 revenue - €35 costs = €182 profit

Annual profit: ~€1,500-2,000 with minimal risk
```

### Year 1 Optimistic Model (10% Pro conversion rate)
```
Month 6:  300 users (30 Pro) = €260 revenue - €33 costs = €227 profit
Month 12: 500 users (50 Pro) = €433 revenue - €35 costs = €398 profit

Annual profit: ~€3,000-4,000 with same infrastructure
```
