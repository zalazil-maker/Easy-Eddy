# Easy Eddy Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Single Node.js Backend Deployment

Easy Eddy is configured for simple, cost-effective deployment using a single Node.js backend that serves the built React frontend.

## 📦 Project Structure

```
root/
├── client/           # React app
│   ├── src/
│   ├── dist/        # built files (created during build)
│   └── vite.config.ts
├── server/          # Node.js backend
│   └── index.ts
├── package.json     # root package.json
└── uploads/         # file storage
```

## 🛠️ Build Process

The deployment uses a two-step build process:

1. **Build Frontend**: `npm run client:build`
   - Builds React app to `client/dist/`
   - Generates optimized production assets

2. **Build Backend**: `npm run build`
   - Builds the entire application
   - Bundles server code with esbuild

## 🎯 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Replit Deployment (Recommended - FREE)
- **Cost**: $0 (included with Replit Core subscription)
- **Setup**: 
  1. Click "Deploy" button in Replit
  2. Replit automatically detects Node.js app
  3. Uses `npm start` command for production

### Option 2: Railway (Free Tier)
- **Cost**: Free tier available
- **Setup**: 
  1. Connect GitHub repository
  2. Railway auto-detects Node.js app
  3. Automatic deployments on git push

### Option 3: Fly.io or Render
- **Cost**: Free tiers available
- **Setup**: Similar to Railway

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Required for production:
```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_url
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
```

## 📊 Deployment Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build for production  
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Database migration
npm run db:push
```

## 🎯 Production Server Features

- **Single Port**: Serves both API and frontend on port 5000
- **API Routes**: `/api/*` → Express API routes
- **Frontend Routes**: `/*` → Serves React `index.html`
- **Static Assets**: Optimized CSS/JS served from `client/dist/`
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Total Monthly Costs: $30-35

1. **Replit Core**: $25/month (includes deployment credits)
2. **Database**: $0 (Neon free tier - 512MB)
3. **File Storage**: $5-10/month (depending on usage)

### Break-even: Only 2-4 Pro subscribers needed!

- Weekly Pro: €2/week = €8.66/month
- Monthly Pro: €4.99/month

## 🔒 Production Optimizations

✅ **Security**: CORS enabled, input validation, error handling
✅ **Performance**: Gzipped assets, optimized chunks
✅ **Monitoring**: Health checks, structured logging
✅ **Scalability**: Auto-scaling on Replit/Railway
✅ **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime guarantees
